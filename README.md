For the electrochemist interested in alternating current voltammetry (ACV)

Two text files of data accompany two python files for interpreting the data.
The file `fraccalc` is a small python package for computing fractional integrals/derivatives of any order, and for baselining functions.
The files `sample_ACV_data` and `sample_CV_data` are text files (CV = cyclic voltammetry).
The file `sample_python_script_for_ACV_fitting` is exactly what it says it is. It uses both sample data files.
The code and data accompany Chase Bruggeman's PhD dissertation (Chapter 2), completed at Michigan State University in Spring 2024.

The file `to_precision.py` allows numbers to be printed with an arbitrary number of sig figs in different notations (standard, scientific, etc.) The package was written by:
